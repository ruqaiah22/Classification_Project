## Introduction:
Cardiovascular diseases are conditions that affect the structures or function of someone heart. Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally. The early prognosis of cardiovascular diseases can aid in making decisions on lifestyle changes in high-risk patients and in turn reduce the complications.


## 	Motivation:
The dataset that we will be using for our prediction is taken form Kaggle. By using this dataset, we will be able to predict the number of people who will have cardiovascular diseases within ten years.

## 	Dataset:
